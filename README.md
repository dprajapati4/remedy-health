## **About the Project**
***
### The Challenge

 Create an that app that consist of two pages (a form, and a feed), and a server that reads and writes to the feed.

The app should
1. Start with the command `npm i && npm run dev`
2. Show a form with “name” and “message” when it runs at localhost:3000
3. When submitting a form, runs a `POST` to `/api/guestbook` and reset with a success message (should show an error if things are missing).
4. A link on the homepage takes you to `/guestbook` and shows all posts that have been submitted from the previous form.
    - A link on that page exists to go back to the homepage
    - You do not need to persist that data in any database, just keep it in memory.
